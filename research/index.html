    <h2> My main scientific interest concerns improving the understanding 
    of the hydrological, chemical, and geologic processes that govern heat transfer in volcanic geothermal systems and act
    to distribute chemical elements throughout the upper crust. I am particularly interested
    in the dynamics of multi-phase fluid flow, rock permeability creation and destruction, and heat transfer, as they 
    collectively govern the behavior of geothermal systems and the productivity of wells drilled into these systems. 
    Flow of high-temperature geothermal fluids containing significant concentrations of reactive compounds leads to dissolution
    of primary minerals, precipitation of secondary alteration minerals, and changes the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rock mass, 
    which in turn permeability changes that alter fluid flow dynamics.</h2>
		
		<h1>Supercritical fluids at the magma-hydrothermal interface</h1>
	<p>There is long-standing and growing interest in targeting ‘supercritical’ geothermal resources at temperature and pressure conditions in excess 
	of the critical point of pure water (374 &#8451, 22.06 MPa), due to the potential for a roughly order-of-magnitude increased electricity generation from wells drilled into such reservoirs compared to conventional high-enthalpy 
	wells. In 2011-2013, the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (<a href="http://www.iddp.is">IDDP</a>) discovered the first supercritical 
	geothermal resources in the Krafla system. While the borehole was initially intended to be drilled to >4 km depth, which
	would provide fluid pressures greater than the critical pressure of water, drilling stopped after encountering a magma chamber
	at 2.2 km depth. Although the well was much shallower than anticipated, well testing indicated that the borehole was the world’s hottest geothermal 
	well (430 &#8451) with the potential to generate roughly 35 MWe, thus representing approximately half of the total field generating capacity from a single well. </p>
		<p> During the first part of my PhD work, I sought to answer some basic questions about supercritical geothermal resources 
	and particularly the hydrology of the IDDP-1 reservoir (published in <a target="_blank" href="/papers/Scott, 
	Driesner, Weis - 2015 - Geologic controls on supercritical geothermal resources above magmatic intrusions.pdf"><i>Nature Communcations</i></a>). I set up the model such that the main sources
	of geologic variability between different geothermal settings could be investigated, including the depth of the intrusion, 
	the host rock permeability (a measure of how fractured the system is as a result of tectonic activity) and the brittle-ductile
	transition temperature (which determines the temperature where rock becomes impermeable due to plastic deformation closing 
	connecting fluid flow pathways). </p>

	<p> These models show how these primary geologic controls determine the extent and thermal conditions
	of supercritical reservoirs. For example, a brittle-ductile transition temperature greater than 450 &#8451 is a control on reservoir formation. Since
	basalt has a brittle-ductile transition temperature &gt 450 &#8451, while granite becomes impermeable around 360 &#8451, the best resources will probably 
	be found in basaltic rocks, typical of Iceland. Additionally, if the rock surrounding the intrusion is highly permeable (<b>A</b>), 
	supercritical resources will be close to the intrusion, relatively limited in spatial extent, and at temperatures near 400 &#8451. If the rock surrounding
	the intrusion is moderately permeable (<b>B</b>), the reservoirs will be larger and at higher temperatures. However, the fluid production rate for a well
	drilled into a supercritical reservoir will be higher when rock permeability is higher. Thus, there is a trade-off between fluid temperature and well
	productivity that is governed primarily by rock permeability. </p>
	<p> Furthermore, the models reproduce measured data from the IDDP-1 well when the geologic controls are set
	to appropriate values for the Krafla system. This supports the model set-up, as well as the conclusion that supercritical 
	geothermal resource properties depend on the geologic controls. In contrast to previous thoughts that fluid pressures in 
	excess of the critical pressure of pure water are necessary for supercritical resource formation, the high
	enthalpy of water at supercritical temperatures and subcritical pressures actually promotes the development of economically 
	attractive resources above shallow intrusions. Moreover, the models show how conventional geothermal resources result simply from 
	the mixing of supercritical fluids ascending from the intrusion and cooler fluids circulating near the intrusion but not heated 
	to supercritical conditions. These are new ways to look at conventional and supercritical high-enthalpy geothermal reservoirs. </p>
	
	<h1>The thermal structure and temporal evolution of geothermal systems</h1>
	<p> While geothermal reservoir simulation is an essential tool for understanding and managing geothermal systems, geothermal reservoir 
	engineers are often tasked to build preliminary models with little or no development history .For such instances, a conceptual 
	model describing the thermal and hydrological features of magma-driven geothermal systems is crucial to inform estimates of a field’s
	potential electricity generation capacity and decision-making concerning the location and depth of exploration wells. Early numerical 
	simulations in the 1970s of hydrothermal convection around magmatic intrusions showed that the system behavior and lifetime are 
	strongly impacted by host rock permeability. Subsequent studies included the full thermodynamics of boiling water to magmatic 
	conditions and demonstrated that host rock permeability controls the development of boiling zones and the overall thermal structure 
	of a system. While the near-surface parts of systems are at boiling conditions through the main and later parts of system evolution,
	systems may have different plume geometries, deep thermal structures, and hydraulic behavior depending on the host rock permeability 
	and the stage in the system lifetime. </p>

	<p>A second part of my PhD showed how key geologic variables control the depth and extent of boiling zones, the number and spatial 
	configuration of upflow plumes, and how these aspects evolve over the systems' lifetime (published in <a target="_blank" href="/papers/Scott, 
	Driesner, Weis - 2016 - The thermal structure and temporal evolution of high-enthalpy geothermal systems.pdf"><i>Geothermics</i></a>). Host rock
	permeability is a primary control on the general structure, temperature distribution and extent of boiling zones, as systems
	with high permeability show shallow boiling zones restricted to ≤1 km depth, while intermediate permeability systems display 
	vertically extensive boiling zones reaching from the surface to the intrusion.  Intrusion emplacement depth is a further control, 
	as intermediate permeability systems driven by an intrusion at ≥3 km depth only show boiling above 1 km. The development of 
	multiple, spatially separated upflow plumes above a single intrusive body is characteristic of systems with high permeability and 
	deep emplacement depth. Systems exhibit characteristic lateral and vertical gradients in pressure, temperature and enthalpy 
	relative to the intrusive heat source, which may aid in geothermal exploration and interpretation of field measurements.

	<h1> Phase segregation and the gas geochemistry of high-temperature systems </h1>
	<p>
		As a Master's student at the Iceland School of Energy,  I studied the geochemistry of high-temperature geothermal 
	fluids from the Hellisheiði geothermal field, working closely with geochemists from the University of Iceland and 
	Reykjavik Energy (the field’s owner and operator). Based on samples of vapor and liquid that I helped collect from geothermal
	wells, the deep aquifer fluid chemical compositions were reconstructed (published in  <a target="_blank" href="/papers/Scott, 
	Driesner, Weis - 2016 - Gas chemistry, boiling and phase segregation in a geothermal system, Hellisheidi, Iceland.pdf"><i>Geochimica et 
	Cosmochimica Acta</i></a>). Our study systematically 
	investigated the effect of phase segregation, an economically significant open-system boiling process that causes some wells 
	drilled into liquid-dominated boiling reservoirs to discharge nearly pure vapor, and explained the effect of this
	process on reconstructions of aquifer fluid chemical compositions from surface measurements. The study emphasized the
	chemistry of the reactive gases, since their concentrations give information about the temperature and vapor content of 
	the deep reservoirs.
