    <p> My main scientific interest concerns improving the understanding 
    of the hydrological, chemical, and geologic processes that govern heat transfer in volcanic geothermal systems and act
    to distribute chemical elements throughout the upper crust. I am particularly interested
    in the dynamics of multi-phase fluid flow, rock permeability creation and destruction, and heat transfer, as they 
    collectively govern the behavior of geothermal systems and the productivity of wells drilled into these systems. 
    Flow of high-temperature geothermal fluids containing significant concentrations of reactive compounds leads to dissolution
    of primary minerals, precipitation of secondary alteration minerals, and changes the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rock mass, 
    which in turn permeability changes that alter fluid flow dynamics.</p>
		
		<h1>Supercritical fluids at the magma-hydrothermal interface</h1>
	<p>There is long-standing and growing interest in targeting ‘supercritical’ geothermal resources at temperature and pressure conditions in excess 
	of the critical point of pure water (374 &#8451, 22.06 MPa) in the near-vicinity of the magmatic intrusion, due to the potential for roughly 
	an order-of-magnitude increased electricity generation from wells drilled into such reservoirs compared to conventional high-enthalpy 
	wells. In 2011-2013, the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) discovered the first supercritical geothermal resources in the Krafla system.
	While the borehole was initially intended to be drilled to >4 km depth, which would provide fluid pressures greater than the 
	critical pressure of water, drilling stopped after encountering a magma chamber at 2.2 km depth. Although the well was much
	shallower than anticipated, well testing indicated that the borehole was the world’s hottest geothermal well (430 &#8451) and had the potential
	to generate roughly 35 MWe, thus representing approximately half of the total field generating capacity from a single well. </p>
		<p> During the first part of my PhD work, I sought to answer some basic questions about supercritical geothermal resources 
	and particularly the hydrology of the IDDP-1 reservoir (published in <i>Nature Communcations</i>). I set up the model such that the main sources
	of geologic variability between different geothermal settings could be investigated, including the depth of the intrusion, 
	the host rock permeability (a measure of how fractured the system is as a result of tectonic activity) and the brittle-ductile
	transition temperature (which determines the temperature where rock becomes impermeable due to plastic deformation closing 
	connecting fluid flow pathways). These models show how these primary geologic controls determine the extent and thermal conditions
			of supercritical reservoirs. </p>

	<p> For example, our study identified a brittle-ductile transition temperature greater than 450 &#8451 as a control on reservoir formation. Since
	basalt has a brittle-ductile transition temperature &gt 450 &#8451, while granite becomes impermeable around 360 &#8451, we expect that the best resources will
	be found in basaltic rocks, typical of Iceland. Additionally, if the rock surrounding the intrusion is highly permeable (<b>A</b>), we expect the
	supercritical resources to be close to the intrusion, relatively limited in spatial extent, and at temperatures near 400 &#8451. If the rock surrounding
	the intrusion is moderately permeable (<b>B</b>), the reservoirs will be larger and at higher temperatures. However, the fluid production rate for a well
	drilled into a supercritical reservoir will be higher when rock permeability is higher. Thus, there is a trade-off between fluid temperature and well
	productivity that is governed primarily by rock permeability. </p>
