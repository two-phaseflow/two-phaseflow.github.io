	<p> <h2>I am a scientist who recently completed a PhD and period of post-doctoral research in the 
    <a href="http://www.orefluids.ethz.ch">Fluids and Mineral Resources group</a> of the 
    <a href="http://www.geopetro.ethz.ch">Institute of Gechemistry and Petrology</a> at ETH Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. 
    I'm interested in how the hydrology and chemistry of fluids in high-temperature geothermal systems can improve our ability to
	produce clean, reliable renewable energy from these systems.  I'm currently living in Copenhagen, Denmark with my 
    girlfriend<a href"http://nfi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/440678"> Beeke Stegmann</a>, and 
		am keeping my eyes open for the right employment opportunity in the geothermal industry. </h2> </p>
