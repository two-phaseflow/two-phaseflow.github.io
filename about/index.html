<h2>I am a scientist who recently completed a PhD in the 
    <a href="http://www.orefluids.ethz.ch">Fluids and Mineral Resources group</a> of the 
    <a href="http://www.geopetro.ethz.ch">Institute of Gechemistry and Petrology</a> at ETH Zurich. 
    I research the hydrology and chemistry of fluids in high-temperature geothermal systems to improve our ability to
	 reliably generate electricity from these systems.  I'm currently living in Copenhagen, Denmark with my 
    fianc√©e <a href"http://nfi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/440678">Beeke Stegmann</a>, and 
		am keeping my eyes open for the right employment opportunity in the geothermal industry. </h2>
