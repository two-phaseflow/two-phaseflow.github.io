The drilling of the second well of Iceland Deep Drilling Project ([IDDP](http://iddp.is)) 
was finished on January 25th.  The IDDP-2 was the result of extending an existing well RN-15
 (which was initially ~2 km depth) to a depth of 4,659 m. The well was drilled at the Reykjanes
 geothermal power plant, which is operated by HS Orka, in collaboration with Landsvirkjun, 
Orkuveita Reykjavíkur and Iceland’s National Energy Authority, with active participation of Statoil and
substantial grants from the EU H2020  as well as other international science grants 
well was completed to a measured depth of 4659 m. At a [triumphant informational meeting]
(http://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/supercritical-heat-high-pressure-iddp-successfully-concludes-drilling-campaign/) in Reykjavik on Februrary 1,
results of the drilling were announced in Icelandic, and the IDDP also released an [informational sheet]
(http://iddp.is/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IDDP-2-Completion-websites-IDDP-DEEPEGS.pdf) on the project website.

Measured temperatures and pressures 

During drilling, there was complete loss of circulation below 3 km that could not be solved with lost circulation 
materials, or by multiple attempts to seal the loss zone with cement. This indcates that there were high 
permeability structure at this depth, which is encouraging as a major worry of drilling to such depths and temperatures
is low permeability. While loss of circulation meant that drill cuttings couldn't be returned to the surface, thirteen 
coring runs were conducted that recieved a total of 37 m. The last coring run returned some 7 m of core from ~4,650 m depth! This core 
will be useful for learning about the petrologic and geochemical evolution of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems, since the Reykjanes 
system is located on the tip of a peninsula where the mid-ocean ridge comes onto land.
