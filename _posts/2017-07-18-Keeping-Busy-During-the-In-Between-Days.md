This post will serve to update anyone who's curious enough about me to read my blog about how I've been keeping busy since the completion of my PhD at ETH Zurich last July. After working for a brief stint (4 months) as a Post-Doc, finalizing the thesis and finishing up some papers. I also had a couple grant applications submitted. Alas, which were unfortunately not awarded - this shouldn't have come as too much of a surprise. This experience taught me that I'm not immune from the hypercompetitive funding environment in academia.
The in-between-jobs days have not always been easy - unemployment never is. But I knew from the get-go that is was important to continually have something to look forward to, and various projects to keep my attention. So - besides working on this website- here is what I've been up to. 
In February, I traveled to Palo Alto for the Stanford Geothermal Workshop. Unfortunately, I was too late to submit an abstract and give a talk, but there were a lot of interesting talks. This was my second time at the workshop - it was great seeing familiar faces (mostly from Iceland) and meeting some new people in the geothermal industry and academia. I enjoyed the inaugural session which traditionally work done at the Stanford group (Carla Co, Anna Suzuki and others). Under the leadership of Prof. Roland Horne, this gorup is always exploring cutting edge techniques for investigating geothermal fluid properties and fractured reservoirs.
In March, I attended a workshop in San Diego about corrosion-related challenges in drilling and production in geothermal systems. Although the main focus of the workshop was on drilling fluids and materials-engineering, as a geoscientist I attended was interested to learn how to manage the 'supercritical'-type reservoirs. I learned a lot about a whole variety of scaling and corrision concepts, the properties of different steels, I was somewhat surprised about the lack of discussion of what controls the temperature, enthalpy and composition of fluid resources. I believe that there remain important basic geoscientific contributions that need to be made to understand the chemical conditions that contribute to scaling and corrision.   Sometimes it seems like geothermal geoscientists and engineers operate on separate planes - however, knowledge from both of these levels is necessary for successful exploitation. On a personal level, I was pleasantly surprised to see my good friend Siggi Markusson at the conference (and walk around San Diego together), I was also glad to meet a diverse group of participants, especially Sigrun Karlsdottir at the University of Iceland.
In May, I attended a short course in Geothermal Reservoir Engineering at the International Geothermal Academy in Bochum, Germany taught by Dr. Saddiq Zarrouk. It was really interesting to gain perspective from the New Zealand approach to geothermal systems. 
Now, I'm happy to announce that I starting a post-doctoral position at Reykjavik University doing data fusion for geothermal reservoir characterization. I'm excited to see what the future will bring.
